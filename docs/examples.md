# Solutions and Example Scripts
This section provides working solutions and examples to 
some of the most common tasks you will face when working with Apstra. 
The goal is not to provide complete scripts for use but to outline and 
walk through each step in completing the task, so you can understand the 
possible API endpoints and elements needed to build the solution.

>NOTE: 
> These code samples and solution scripts are not built to be run directly
> and are provided as-is. Please understand fully what code you are 
> running and what systems will be effected before running any of the 
> following code samples and solutions scripts.
