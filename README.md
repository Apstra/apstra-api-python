# Apstra Rest API Python Library
## What is apstra-api-python?
The apstra-api-python library is an example python library built for
learning how to integrate with the Apsta API programmatically. This
library also includes examples to common solutions faced when building and
managing an Apstra managed fabric.

## Documentation
If you are new to Apstra, this library, or looking to get a better understanding of 
the apstra Rest API please start with the 
[documentation](https://apstra-api-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The documentation includes an introduction to the Apstra API along with a catalog
of working examples of common tasks within Apstra using this library.

## What apstra-api-python is not
While the apstra-api-python library can be used to build integrations with
Apstra, it is not intended to be a production-ready solution.
apstra-api-python does not include 100% coverage of the Apstra API and all
use-cases available.

Our hope is to provide enough working examples and documentation to get a
developer started with building client libraries based on the Apstra API.
